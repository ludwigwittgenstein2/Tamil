    "title": "Kodai: A Software Architecture and Implementation for Segmentation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. This tool supports analysis of supermarket products and generates results to interpret consumer behavior, to give businesses deeper insights into targeted consumer markets. The software design developed is named as Kodai. Kodai is horizontally reusable and can be adapted across various industries. This software framework allows testing a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Kodai has several advantages, such as analyzing and visualizing data, and as a result, businesses can make better decisions. In addition to these advantages, Kodai is open-source, which means any developer can access the code, and develop into client requirements. With the described features, it is better than other similar tools such as Gephi, a free visualization and manipulation tool.\nThe retail industry has grown exponentially, resulting in increasing demand for software tools to analyze consumer behavior. The analysis of consumer behavior helps businesses to stay at the forefront of market competition and provide excellent service. By focusing on consumer purchase behavior, Kodai can perform analyses, meaning it can classify consumers based on variables that capture their behavior. An example is identifying consumers who spend the most amount of money in a supermarket.\nSegmentation models provide qualitative and quantitative methods to improve service for the customer and revenues for the company. These models can be used in different fields such as finance, education and healthcare. Another important feature of Gephi is its interactive and visual modeling capabilities to help understand consumer behavior. Additionally, the software is reusable and supports the integration of future tools, following key extensibility concepts of software design.\nThis thesis explains the implementation of Kodai as a software architecture through segmentation models using a web-based application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues and consumer experience. This tool is developed to facilitate segmentation of consumer data based on purchase behavior with the goal of allowing the user to test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Most importantly, the software is reusable and can be adapted horizontally across various industries.\n\n\n Download \n\n\nOur work in this thesis helps to show that Kodai is a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. It can test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets.\nWe achieved this by allowing the user to upload supermarket data within the software framework, using a webbased application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues, allowing the developer to complete business requirements to be built into the software."

This means that in your text, you can refer to the figure number and link to the figure. This will automatically update your figure numbers and is achieved by typing the ‘@’ symbol followed by the figure label. As an example, ‘@fig-sleep’ turns into Figure 1.\nThere is an additional option to let the figures take up the width of the entire page, but I would not recommend using it as it extends beyond the width of the body of your page.

Moviebarcode is a great methodology to extract insightful features to describe narratives in a video, capturing visual patterns in a video without watching, and grouping/categorizing similar/same videos together in fast and efficient manner. Results show that using individual channels of a moviebarcode image helps video categorization by differentiating one video from another or grouping them. Each channel carries different features about an image. The idea of splitting channels of an image increased the performance of video categorization"

    "text": "3. What is my own view on this?\nI want to bring better insight in this. My own insight is the following.\nEntire narrative of Tamil Society is to gain:\n\n\nHonor (Munju)\nand not to lose, Face (kaevalam)**\n\n\nTo lose face (kaevalam), is to lose your identity.\nWhen someone loses face, they lose their life or standing in society. Japanese soldiers in WW2, would kill themselves instead of being defeated –Why? Because, they lose face and they bring shame to their community. Therefore, killing themselves is more honorable.\nI would cite anthropologist, Ruth Benedict in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, for bringing this perspective. She wrote about Japanese culture. This view is not present in any of the discussions in understanding culture.\nBasic unit of Tamil Culture is family, mother-father’s face (munju) or family name. Next, you are part of a community (caste) or (religion). There is fierce competition to gain face among relatives, caste or religious community through socio-economic ways in Tamil Nadu.\nOne might object that caste ought to be removed. Yes — What would replace that vacuum of social hierarchy of relationship?\nHow would communities represent themselves politically?\n\nAdvantages of honor/shame:\n\n\nBehaviors can be controlled by shame\nCompetition among people\nFamilies are close-knit\nLoyalty to clan\nNot wanting shame motivates people\nStrict hierarchy: Person knows their role in society\n\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of honor/shame:\n\n\nPeople are not honest\nPeople would cover up their short-comings during conversation\nIt is actually not a lie when they cover up, it’s just they don’t want to lose face\nBut real relationship starts with vulnerability\nTrust comes through by accepting vulnerability.\n\n\nTruth is less important when it comes with face. To hold face is more important. How did you change your view on criminal tribes and caste?\nThis is related to the book. Most people in Tamil Nadu, hold the view, “some people in a community are born criminals, some have innate nature to do so.” Many years ago — I was on a road trip with an American friend.\nI remember constantly telling him, i.e some castes are violent or bad, their character is bad, their character is to do evil. He stopped the car, and told me, wait, “You are calling someone bad or violent or murderer before they even commit such act.” How can you say it? I could not understand what I was thinking. Apparently, I had labeled people. Before, even they are born, to malign their character. This is clearly wrong. People can change, characters can be changed innately by emulating desirable traits.\nIn Tamil Nadu, even older people, would say, “It’s like it, this community is as such.” Within the narrative of religious tradition it says:\n\n\nPeople are created in the image of their Creator\nHis Creator has reason, dignity, love along with other attributes\nPeople are bestowed with these attributes\nTherefore, people are to be respected, loved with dignity\n\n\nYou might contest the above narrative. Good luck forming a secular origin of human dignity. It took me so much time to realize, I was wrong. We can’t label an entire community. Later, I spent more time to figure out, what was happening. Most of the time, people grow up in a family, and then stay within their community. Now, people hear about other community through the lens of that community. Would we look into our own family, community through the lens of others, and improve ourselves?\nThis might be because, the value of the community picks up specific aspects of other community, and labels them. It could be confirmation bias."

Apply honor-shame, we can answer, “to gain face.” (Munju) to get, “honor.” or “respect” among others within their community.\nHow can they change?\nAuthor says Education can change people.\nWhat other work would you recommend?\nThere has been no contemporary account of caste that matches up Edgar Thurston. Thurston’s work is outdated, because it is filled with racial denigration.\nSociologists have written about Caste. If you want to know about Caste in Tamil Nadu. I suggest reading, Edgar Thurston. His work is outdated, but some parts of it, might be relevant. Apparently, in 2019, I discovered Edgar was the first to hold Librarian title— Connemara Public Library.\nFeel free to write a rebuttal to my perspective.\n\n1 References2 Caste, plays core role in Politcs in Tamil Nadu, India"
