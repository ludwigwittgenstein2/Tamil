The violence was triggered by the legislative assembly by-election, following U. Muthuramalinga Thevar’s resignation. In the peace conference organized by the local administration, Muthuramalinga Thevar objected to the presence of Immanuel Sekaran as a Dalit representative.\n\n\nThis is a long review. You may gain new perspective. Read it completely. Book is clear, well-researched, easy to follow.\n\n## 1. Why should you read this Book?\n\nIf you are interested in Tamil Nadu, Caste, Social Justice, Politics.\n\n## 2. Why did I read this book?\n\nI took this book to expand my understanding of caste-conflict, history of caste in Tamil Nadu.\n\n## 3. What is my own view on this?\n\nI want to bring better insight in this. My own insight is the following.\n\nEntire narrative of Tamil Society is to gain:\n\n> a) Honor (Munju)\n  b) and not to lose, Face (kaevalam)**\n\nTo lose face (kaevalam), is to lose your identity.\n\nWhen someone loses face, they lose their life or standing in society.\nJapanese soldiers in WW2, would kill themselves instead of being defeated --Why? Because, they lose face and they bring shame to their community. Therefore, killing themselves is more honorable.\n\nI would cite anthropologist, Ruth Benedict in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, for bringing this perspective. She wrote about Japanese culture.\nThis view is not present in any of the discussions in understanding culture.\n\nBasic unit of Tamil Culture is family, mother-father’s face (munju) or family name. Next, you are part of a community (caste) or (religion).\nThere is fierce competition to gain face among relatives, caste or religious community through socio-economic ways in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOne might object that caste ought to be removed.\nYes — What would replace that vacuum of social hierarchy of relationship?\n\nHow would communities represent themselves politically?\n\n### Advantages of honor/shame:\n\n> a) Behaviors can be controlled by shame\nb) Competition among people\nc) Families are close-knit\nd) Loyalty to clan\ne) Not wanting shame motivates people\nf) Strict hierarchy: Person knows their role in society\n\n### Drawbacks of honor/shame:\n\n> a) People are not honest\nb) People would cover up their short-comings during conversation\nc) It is actually not a lie when they cover up, it's just they don't want to lose face\nd) But real relationship starts with vulnerability\ne) Trust comes through by accepting vulnerability.\n\nTruth is less important when it comes with face.\nTo hold face is more important.\nHow did you change your view on criminal tribes and caste?\n\nThis is related to the book.\nMost people in Tamil Nadu, hold the view, “some people in a community are born criminals, some have innate nature to do so.”\nMany years ago — I was on a road trip with an American friend.\n\nI remember constantly telling him, i.e some castes are violent or bad, their character is bad, their character is to do evil.\nHe stopped the car, and told me, wait, “You are calling someone bad or violent or murderer before they even commit such act.” How can you say it?\nI could not understand what I was thinking. Apparently, I had labeled people. Before, even they are born, to malign their character. This is clearly\nwrong. People can change, characters can be changed innately by emulating desirable traits.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, even older people, would say, “It’s like it, this community is as such.”\nWithin the narrative of religious tradition it says:\n\n> i) People are created in the image of their Creator\nii) His Creator has reason, dignity, love along with other attributes\niii) People are bestowed with these attributes\niv) Therefore, people are to be respected, loved with dignity\n\nYou might contest the above narrative. Good luck forming a secular origin of human dignity.\nIt took me so much time to realize, I was wrong. We can’t label an entire community.\nLater, I spent more time to figure out, what was happening.\nMost of the time, people grow up in a family, and then stay within their community. Now, people hear about other community through the lens of that community.\nWould we look into our own family, community through the lens of others, and improve ourselves?\n\nThis might be because, the value of the community picks up specific aspects of other community, and labels them. It could be confirmation bias.\n\n## 4. What’s the meat of the book?\n\nIn this book, author Mani Kumar talks about the riots of Mudukulathur, located close to Ramanathapuram in Southern Tamil Nadu.\nIt’s about two communities — Pallars and Thevars.\nMani Kumar gives an account on political history, social justice, caste-conflict among the two communities.\nIn Tamil Nadu political history, caste plays a crucial role. Each community aligns with a political party.\nThere’s gruesome killings on each side of caste.\nWhen I was reading through account of it. Few questions came to my mind.\nA question - one person gets killed for an issue from a caste. And then, the other community kills or retaliates back.\nBut it goes back and forth, where does it stop?\n\n### What is the point of doing it?\n\nIn the book or even applying to Tamil society, insight from anthropologists.\nApply honor-shame, we can answer, “to gain face.” (Munju) to get, “honor.” or “respect” among others within their community.\n\nHow can they change?\n\nAuthor says Education can change people.\n\nWhat other work would you recommend?\n\nThere has been no contemporary account of caste that matches up Edgar Thurston.\nThurston's work is outdated, because it is filled with racial denigration.\n\nSociologists have written about Caste.\nIf you want to know about Caste in Tamil Nadu.\nI suggest reading, Edgar Thurston. His work is outdated, but some parts of it, might be relevant.\nApparently, in 2019, I discovered Edgar was the first to hold Librarian title— Connemara Public Library.\n\nFeel free to write a rebuttal to my perspective.\n\n---\n[^1] References[^2] Caste, plays core role in Politcs in Tamil Nadu, India\n\n[^1]: [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3566094304)Goodreads\n[^2]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudukulathur) Wikipedia\n\n",
