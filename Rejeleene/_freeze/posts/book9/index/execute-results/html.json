Who would you recommend this work? <a name=\"paragraph2\"></a>\n\nMostly to casual readers, anyone who want to know mainstream culture of America.\n\nDoes not apply to non-Western Culture,\n\nMajority of World's population.\n\n## 3. So, Would this be relevant to Tamil People? <a name=\"paragraph3\"></a>\n\nNo\n\n\n## 4. What are my own thoughts on this work? <a name=\"paragraph4\"></a>\n\nBefore you read this work, ask the following questions\n\n**{Western Culture:}**\n1. What is the goal of your life?\n2. How would you define success?\n3. What does a meaningful life look for you?\n\n\n**{Tamil Culture:}**\n1. What is the goal of your family?\n2. How does your family define success?\n3. How does a meaningful life look for your family?\n\nWhile back, a Stanford B.S in Computer Science Educated CEO from Bangalore, said, his goal in life is to optimize everything, tweak his entire life for maximum output = Money\n\n**{Would you agree with him?}**\n\nFor him, marriage is a way to optimize his life, like an algorithm.\n\nSo, I'd label his view of marriage as, \"Business theory of Performance based Marriage\" devoid of meta-narratives.\n\nGrowing up in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India;\n\nThe narrative of Marriage choice depended on\n\n1) caste\n2) religion\n3) socio-economic background\n\nTamil Nadu’s Institution of marriage is forged by customs, traditions & religion, safe-guarded by older generation. Within Tamil Marriages - Personal choice is part of family’s broader decision in marriage.\n\nPost-marriage in Tamil Nadu is \"adjust pani vaalanum\" , [Tamil] adjust with each other, live life. [English]\n\n\n## 5. I don't have much time, but what is the meat of this work? <a name=\"paragraph5\"></a>\n\nWell, turn to page 162 in this work.\n\nHe says,\n\n\"At its core, the all-or-nothing theory of marriage is a supply-and-demand model:\n\nAre, two of us investing enough resources—and the right kinds of resources —to meet the needs we’re seeking to fulfill through the marriage?\n\nThis analysis offers three types of strategies for improving marriage.\n\nWe can,\n\n(1) try to get more mileage out of our available resources,\n\n(2) invest additional resources in pursuit of large rewards at the summit,\n\nor (3) recalibrate expectations to stave off disappointment.\n\nThe first two of these strategies focus on the supply side (either by enhancing efficiency or increasing investment),\n\nwhereas the third focuses on the demand side (by descending Mount Maslow or otherwise asking less of the marriage).\"\n\n**{My thoughts: Good luck in applying marriage as an optimization problem}**\n\n## 6. What are the things, that I see lacking in this work? <a name=\"paragraph6\"></a>\n\nThe Author missed a core crucial important assumption, “Worldview”\n\nThe Author before fleshing out his research, experiments, data points, might wanted to have written his, “First-Principles”\n\nThe Author, albeit not fleshing out his Worldview;\n\n--I as a reader, would infer his data, experiments and work fitting into Worldview called, \"Business theory of Performance based Marriage\"\n\nThe Author’s goal of marriage is success, defined subjectively.\n\nThis book is incomplete, because it does not including religious traditions.\n\nAnyone who has read history, could bring up points saying, it has shaped marriage.\n\n---\n\n",
