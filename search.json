One of the reason, is because of his turgid concepts and definitions. However, I do not think he is the most difficult writer or thinker to be read in Western thought. Brilliant, intense, profound, deepest thinker, so far I know is – Jonathan Edwards. Reading Edwards requires more intensity, attention, concentration.\nKant is crucial and key for understanding, Western Modern Philosophy. He’s definitely worth reading. Engaging his work, your thoughts or way of expressing would raise, why? Because, we engage with people who are better than us."

    "text": "3. What did I learn from Kant?\nThe important things I learnt from this book, his approach to Knowledge. He says, Knowledge we gain is systematized through our senses. Yes, our knowledge starts from experience, but Kant does not claim that all knowledge must be from experience alone or through reason alone. He calls his system, transcendental knowledge, which does not mean beyond our experience but it means knowledge which both synthetical and a priori. Imagine, you are wearing blue glasses, And look at the world. The world you perceive, will be blue through your eyes, which you will never get to find out, Why?\nTherefore, Kant says, we are unable to completely understand the world. He classifies these as Noumena and Phenomena. Noumena is the reality, the thing itself. Phenomena is the appearance of the thing. Space and time constitute as a foundation for everything. In the blue color perception, the color blue is the Noumena, and Glasses are Phenomena.\nKant’s writings on cosmological, ontological arguments were imposing, majestic and stirs my thought. If you’re interested more in Philosophy of Religion, do check out Graham Oppy’s work.\n\n“Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind” - Kant\n\n\n Goodreads"

Moviebarcode is a great methodology to extract insightful features to describe narratives in a video, capturing visual patterns in a video without watching, and grouping/categorizing similar/same videos together in fast and efficient manner. Results show that using individual channels of a moviebarcode image helps video categorization by differentiating one video from another or grouping them. Each channel carries different features about an image. The idea of splitting channels of an image increased the performance of video categorization"

This means that in your text, you can refer to the figure number and link to the figure. This will automatically update your figure numbers and is achieved by typing the ‘@’ symbol followed by the figure label. As an example, ‘@fig-sleep’ turns into Figure 1.\nThere is an additional option to let the figures take up the width of the entire page, but I would not recommend using it as it extends beyond the width of the body of your page. It requires the following code:\n```{r}\n#| column: page\n```"

    "section": "",
    "text": "1. Why read this work?\n\nTo get an introduction to Economics\nTo understand Indian Macro-Economics\nTo weave together different economic school of thought\nTo understand how caste system affects broader Indian Society\n\n\n\n2. What does Alex say in this work?\nOutline:\n\nWhat is economics\nConceptualizing the macroeconomy\nMoney and interest rates\nOutput and employment levels\nEconomic growth\nWhy economic theory matters\nThe policy objective of full employment\nThe policy objective of low inflation\nTowards good economics\n\nLet me try to summarize my highlights\nSo, Alex wants you to understand economics is not a settled science. I recall, he mentioned it is ongoing discussion among economists. In many of the college textbooks, they might present it as settled. He asks students, learners to inquiry, ask questions.\nI liked the quote from Keynes,\n“He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man’s nature or his institution lie entirely outside of his regard”\nWhile reading this quote, I thought of earlier history of India. Many might recall, Colonialism, many have to be understood in contextual clue. At that time, it seems to me that Mercantilism was the school of thought, which says a country has to export more than imports.\nI want the reader to ask, “How did economic school of thought impact EIC in India?”\nAlex furthermore shares briefly about History of Economics:\n\nEIC\nMercantilism\nPolitical Economists\nMarginalist\nClassical Economists\nKeynesian Economics\n20th Century [Monetarism, Institutionalism, Sraffa’s Economics, Samuel’s Textbook]\n\nAdam Smith was interested in finding nature of wealth, causes of wealth in nations\nAdam Smith says,\nPolitical economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects: first, to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people, or more properly to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and secondly, to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services. It proposes to enrich people and sovereign.\nRicardo says, “the Principal Problem [remaining] in Political Economy is to determine, laws which to regulate, distribution of rent, profit and wages.”\nIn later chapter, Alex says, Economics these days are redefining the field as, “Science of Choice”\nAlex has communicated basics of Macro-Economics coherently. His analysis or focus is on Indian Economy, which is not same as developed economies in West. Economists have conceptualized sectors such as Primary, Secondary, Tertiary. These are ways to understand sectors, growth for Economists. I recall, Alex stating, Service sector is growing, which means more jobs in the field.\nPrimary Sector includes agriculture, here is where Caste comes in play. Due to less manufacturing jobs available in India; Imagine being an Adivasi’s child, without any skillset or training. What would you work as? Servant of a Billionaire? When reading this, I felt sad.\nMy own understanding is well-being of people of all social strata is to be considered. So, I understood if Construction sector is growing, it affects well-being of construction worker. It makes sense. Recall, what matters is growth of a sector, which is what you belong. This would contribute to your well-being and family.\nHe also mentions how Caste system is rigid, where most of the time, mobility is restricted. Even in Indian Society, Patriarchy limits women with careers. So, something that I thought about, Economists have theories on how to understand, predict or formulate policies. Theories give proper framework, and in one of the chapters. Alex mentions, “There is nothing as practical as a good theory” This seems counter-intuitive to layman, although it is actual truth and reality.\nIn Chapter of Financial Architect, I gained further understanding. I was able to weave my understanding of financial instruments, Depending on liquidity. From LIC Policy, Mutual Fund, Bank Deposit, Currency. This made sense, Economists classify money using their own jargon, M1, M2, M3, M4. Depending on school of thought, economists give answer to employment & output. From what I recall, Keynesian’s work recommends government implication to raise output & employment levels. Marginalist theory tends to state the opposite.\nAlex weaved stories of Families. A Muslim family, without any education. A Bother has to get her sister married, take care of other’s in family [parents]. So, he leaves abroad, sends remittance, such is the pithy of Muslim families. He asks, does Muslims have Agriculture land? Do they have reservation?\nWhile reading this, it helped me to gain further depth understanding in Caste-System. Of course, I do desire for people to gain decent living, so they can provide for their families. In return, families are happy, neighborhoods are happier. There are theories of growth, depending on supply side or demand side. This was interesting for me, mostly one side says, increase in technology. Increase in technology would cause higher growth of economy. In Capitalistic economics, Marx said, there will be a recurrent crisis. This is due to underconsumption & disproportional between sectors.\nAnother question that is in my mind, “So Why is Mercantilism Wrong?” I’m afraid one of the popular CEO’s of Tamil Nadu subscribes to Mercantilism. I could be wrong, not sure. He states, “Exports must be greater than imports” This seems to be obvious as layman, more exports means more wealth correct?\nBrief understanding of Mercantilism. During 1600-1857, Recall, EIC and others were competing for dominance - How? They believed, having more gold [bullion], in exchange of trade, would enable them to raise armies. Recall, this was during time of Slave trade. This was dominant economic school of thought. Smith says, Mercantalism was wrong - Why?\n\nProtectionism policies of Business Interests [British Navigation Act of 1651]\nWealth was not Gold of Nation - so what is it?\nWealth was productivity of Nations\nThis lead to Comparative Advantage\nComparative Advantage lead to specialization\nCreating more efficiency\nIndustrial Revolution thrived due to free trade\nPolicies favoring Big Business, ruling elites would decrease standard of living\nAdditionally, would create higher inequalities\n\nIn the Chapter of Economic Theory, Alex is stating the necessity of good theory. A Good theory enables towards understanding behavior, data, and formulating right policies. Earlier, I shared how good theory is as practical as you can imagine. The Figure which caught my attention was Income level. Furthermore, Caste makes a big role in people’s lives, it seems to debar opportunities, access to mobility. In the Chapter of Inflation: Alex mentions about Wholesale Price Index. So price of basic commodities increases - Why? Depending on your school of thought, you’d give a response. Either Too much money chasing too few goods or A shock to a sector which produces effect, if you are Keynesian.\n\n\n3.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. This tool supports analysis of supermarket products and generates results to interpret consumer behavior, to give businesses deeper insights into targeted consumer markets. The software design developed is named as Kodai. Kodai is horizontally reusable and can be adapted across various industries. This software framework allows testing a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Kodai has several advantages, such as analyzing and visualizing data, and as a result, businesses can make better decisions. In addition to these advantages, Kodai is open-source, which means any developer can access the code, and develop into client requirements. With the described features, it is better than other similar tools such as Gephi, a free visualization and manipulation tool.\nThe retail industry has grown exponentially, resulting in increasing demand for software tools to analyze consumer behavior. The analysis of consumer behavior helps businesses to stay at the forefront of market competition and provide excellent service. By focusing on consumer purchase behavior, Kodai can perform analyses, meaning it can classify consumers based on variables that capture their behavior. An example is identifying consumers who spend the most amount of money in a supermarket.\nSegmentation models provide qualitative and quantitative methods to improve service for the customer and revenues for the company. These models can be used in different fields such as finance, education and healthcare. Another important feature of Gephi is its interactive and visual modeling capabilities to help understand consumer behavior. Additionally, the software is reusable and supports the integration of future tools, following key extensibility concepts of software design.\nThis thesis explains the implementation of Kodai as a software architecture through segmentation models using a web-based application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues and consumer experience. This tool is developed to facilitate segmentation of consumer data based on purchase behavior with the goal of allowing the user to test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Most importantly, the software is reusable and can be adapted horizontally across various industries.\n\n\n Download \n\n\nOur work in this thesis helps to show that Kodai is a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. It can test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets.\nWe achieved this by allowing the user to upload supermarket data within the software framework, using a webbased application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues, allowing the developer to complete business requirements to be built into the software."

    "text": "How Asia Works by Joe Studwell?\nA Superb work to further my understanding on Political Economy. I came to this book, seeking answers for questions in, How can Tamil Nadu modernize itself?\nAsk an average Tamil, he might give answers like, wearing western clothes, jeans, speaking english, buying toys [iPhones, Cars, T.V, Laptop, Internet] is considered to be modern.\nPerhaps, I am one of the few Tamils around the Globe, and within Tamil Nadu to have taken serious interest in the question,\n“How can Tamil Nadu move towards High-Income State?”“\nJoe (author) introduced me to new writers. The parts which were most interesting to me were Fredrich List & Story of Japan. Fredrich List was a Prussian-American Economic writer, journalist is to be read alongside with Adam Smith. List’s writing and work put a serious blow on my earlier assumptions of Adam Smith.\nList developed national theory of economy. He disagrees with Adam Smith, who says private interest of individuals would lead to highest goods in society. Politicians have two goals, one is to present society and future generation, so this brings up to consider productive powers of a nation in the future, rather than immediate value. He says, a nations true wealth lies in productive power. Being familiar with Japanese history, I was surprised to notice, Meiji Era was strongly influenced by List’s National System.\nRecall, Meiji Era lead towards fast paced modernization of Japan. During process of Modernization, Japan pummeled two victories, one over China and another with Russia in wars. Once, Japan pummeled Russia in Russo-Japanese War. India’s perspective shifted on how an Eastern power is able to rise up to the West [Congress Party]\nThis work filled few own gaps of my understanding in Political History. English East India Company followed economic policy of mercantilism, meaning maximize exports, minimize imports. This had serious consequences such as introducing poppy into China and imperialism, where England could maintain more exports. Although, Many Writers have stated, Mercantilism lead British to Global Superpower at one point in History. It is not clear to me, exactly what happened? Britain only embraced, Free Trade around late 1800s, started promoting Free-trade to other nations.\nMajority of Economic Historians have agreed that it was due to EIC and British in India, India lost their wealth. Even though majority might state this view, I tried to look into alternative views and evidence. A minority of Economic Historians state, India was already on the path of poverty, the British happen to accelerate it. From this work – it seems Historically, Nations have protected their industries, it is not clear, what combination or how much it is to be protected?"

    "text": "What is the meat of this work?\nJoe shares how Asian Economics pursued policies leading the path towards becoming Rich.\nAnswer lies in On Page 189:\nJoe lays out as one, two, three steps based on Historical Review of Asia.\n\n\nHousehold Farming — land redistribution (small farmers work on small plots, increasing productivity)\nExport Discipline — focusing on leading exports at global scale, giving subsidies contingent upon future\nFinance which supports the above two, Household farming and Export Discipline\n\n\nBouke van der Bijl says the following, Studwell distills his extensive research into the economies of nine countries—Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China—into an accessible, readable narrative that debunks Western misconceptions, shows what really happened in Asia and why, and for once makes clear why some countries have boomed while others have languished.\nIf Studwell is right, much of the debate over free markets vs. govt. intervention, or mercantilism vs. free trade, or financial discipline vs. profligacy, is a useless distraction for poor countries. The winning strategy is something that economists don’t even have a name for."

    "section": "Here’s How:",
    "text": "Here’s How:\n\nAgricultural development – When a country is underdeveloped and labor is cheap, it should redistribute farmland to small household farms, and make sure that this is done in a sound way such that the land can’t just be accumulated under one landlord again.\n\nThe reason is that ‘gardening’-style farming as done on such farms, while labor-intensive is much more productive per hectare than large-scale mechanized farming. This will lead to a surplus in yields, which will lead to profits for the families, which they can then re-invest in their farms or use to improve their own living conditions.\nThis policy should also be supported with subsidized fertilizer, education, etc. whatever support the government can give to improve the yield of small farmers. The problem in the Philippines is that, while they tried to do land reform, in the end the big families just regained their land through backdoor policies, and to this day are farming them like plantations, which are profitable but don’t provide the biggest amount of welfare for the nation.\n\nIndustrial policy. The country should nurture an infant manufacturing sector through protectionism and export discipline. The author points out that basically every industrialized country did so through protectionism, including Germany, USA, and the UK.\n\nThe developing country should build up their own expertise, for example by doing technology transfers with foreign firms (while maintaining control) until they can innovate on their own. This should be stimulated by the government. An example from the book, is that during the Korean junta they rounded up all the business leaders and forced them to sign a statement that they agreed to listen to the junta, otherwise all of their possessions would be taken from them. They then coerced them into starting manufacturing businesses like cables etc. The other key factor is that the manufacturing businesses should be forced to compete on a global level through ‘export discipline’, which is policy that incentives businesses to export their products, for example by guaranteeing loans based on purchase orders from abroad (like Korea did).\n\nKeep a tight leash on the financial system. The hire part is that the government should rightly control the finance system and ensure it works to their interests, instead of being captured by profiteers.\n\nAn example was that in the Philippines, where the banks were privatized, the big family businesses all had their own banks which would loan money to the family business, which they would just not pay back, leading to the government picking up the cheque. In Malaysia they liberalized the financial system and IPOd companies prematurely, leading to huge stock market bubbles on unproductive companies. Only after industrialization should the banking sector be liberalized bit by bit."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn 1957, intense caste violence broke out in south-eastern Tamil Nadu between the regionally dominant caste of Thevars, and Devendrakula Vellalars (Pallars), a Dalit community. The violence was triggered by the legislative assembly by-election, following U. Muthuramalinga Thevar’s resignation. In the peace conference organized by the local administration, Muthuramalinga Thevar objected to the presence of Immanuel Sekaran as a Dalit representative.\nThis is a long review. You may gain new perspective. Read it completely. Book is clear, well-researched, easy to follow."

    "section": "3. What is my own view on this?",
    "text": "3. What is my own view on this?\nI want to bring better insight in this. My own insight is the following.\nEntire narrative of Tamil Society is to gain:\n\n\nHonor (Munju)\nand not to lose, Face (kaevalam)**\n\n\nTo lose face (kaevalam), is to lose your identity.\nWhen someone loses face, they lose their life or standing in society. Japanese soldiers in WW2, would kill themselves instead of being defeated –Why? Because, they lose face and they bring shame to their community. Therefore, killing themselves is more honorable.\nI would cite anthropologist, Ruth Benedict in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, for bringing this perspective. She wrote about Japanese culture. This view is not present in any of the discussions in understanding culture.\nBasic unit of Tamil Culture is family, mother-father’s face (munju) or family name. Next, you are part of a community (caste) or (religion). There is fierce competition to gain face among relatives, caste or religious community through socio-economic ways in Tamil Nadu.\nOne might object that caste ought to be removed. Yes — What would replace that vacuum of social hierarchy of relationship?\nHow would communities represent themselves politically?\n\nAdvantages of honor/shame:\n\n\nBehaviors can be controlled by shame\nCompetition among people\nFamilies are close-knit\nLoyalty to clan\nNot wanting shame motivates people\nStrict hierarchy: Person knows their role in society\n\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of honor/shame:\n\n\nPeople are not honest\nPeople would cover up their short-comings during conversation\nIt is actually not a lie when they cover up, it’s just they don’t want to lose face\nBut real relationship starts with vulnerability\nTrust comes through by accepting vulnerability.\n\n\nTruth is less important when it comes with face. To hold face is more important. How did you change your view on criminal tribes and caste?\nThis is related to the book. Most people in Tamil Nadu, hold the view, “some people in a community are born criminals, some have innate nature to do so.” Many years ago — I was on a road trip with an American friend.\nI remember constantly telling him, i.e some castes are violent or bad, their character is bad, their character is to do evil. He stopped the car, and told me, wait, “You are calling someone bad or violent or murderer before they even commit such act.” How can you say it? I could not understand what I was thinking. Apparently, I had labeled people. Before, even they are born, to malign their character. This is clearly wrong. People can change, characters can be changed innately by emulating desirable traits.\nIn Tamil Nadu, even older people, would say, “It’s like it, this community is as such.” Within the narrative of religious tradition it says:\n\n\nPeople are created in the image of their Creator\nHis Creator has reason, dignity, love along with other attributes\nPeople are bestowed with these attributes\nTherefore, people are to be respected, loved with dignity\n\n\nYou might contest the above narrative. Good luck forming a secular origin of human dignity. It took me so much time to realize, I was wrong. We can’t label an entire community. Later, I spent more time to figure out, what was happening. Most of the time, people grow up in a family, and then stay within their community. Now, people hear about other community through the lens of that community. Would we look into our own family, community through the lens of others, and improve ourselves?\nThis might be because, the value of the community picks up specific aspects of other community, and labels them. It could be confirmation bias."

    "text": "4. What’s the meat of the book?\nIn this book, author Mani Kumar talks about the riots of Mudukulathur, located close to Ramanathapuram in Southern Tamil Nadu. It’s about two communities — Pallars and Thevars. Mani Kumar gives an account on political history, social justice, caste-conflict among the two communities. In Tamil Nadu political history, caste plays a crucial role. Each community aligns with a political party. There’s gruesome killings on each side of caste. When I was reading through account of it. Few questions came to my mind. A question - one person gets killed for an issue from a caste. And then, the other community kills or retaliates back. But it goes back and forth, where does it stop?\n\nWhat is the point of doing it?\nIn the book or even applying to Tamil society, insight from anthropologists. Apply honor-shame, we can answer, “to gain face.” (Munju) to get, “honor.” or “respect” among others within their community.\nHow can they change?\nAuthor says Education can change people.\nWhat other work would you recommend?\nThere has been no contemporary account of caste that matches up Edgar Thurston. Thurston’s work is outdated, because it is filled with racial denigration.\nSociologists have written about Caste. If you want to know about Caste in Tamil Nadu. I suggest reading, Edgar Thurston. His work is outdated, but some parts of it, might be relevant. Apparently, in 2019, I discovered Edgar was the first to hold Librarian title— Connemara Public Library.\nFeel free to write a rebuttal to my perspective.\n\n1 References2 Caste, plays core role in Politcs in Tamil Nadu, India"
