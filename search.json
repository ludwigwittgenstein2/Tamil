One of the reason, is because of his turgid concepts and definitions. However, I do not think he is the most difficult writer or thinker to be read in Western thought. Brilliant, intense, profound, deepest thinker, so far I know is – Jonathan Edwards. Reading Edwards requires more intensity, attention, concentration.\nKant is crucial and key for understanding, Western Modern Philosophy. He’s definitely worth reading. Engaging his work, your thoughts or way of expressing would raise, why? Because, we engage with people who are better than us."

    "text": "3. What did I learn from Kant?\nThe important things I learnt from this book, his approach to Knowledge. He says, Knowledge we gain is systematized through our senses. Yes, our knowledge starts from experience, but Kant does not claim that all knowledge must be from experience alone or through reason alone. He calls his system, transcendental knowledge, which does not mean beyond our experience but it means knowledge which both synthetical and a priori. Imagine, you are wearing blue glasses, And look at the world. The world you perceive, will be blue through your eyes, which you will never get to find out, Why?\nTherefore, Kant says, we are unable to completely understand the world. He classifies these as Noumena and Phenomena. Noumena is the reality, the thing itself. Phenomena is the appearance of the thing. Space and time constitute as a foundation for everything. In the blue color perception, the color blue is the Noumena, and Glasses are Phenomena.\nKant’s writings on cosmological, ontological arguments were imposing, majestic and stirs my thought.

    "section": "How Asia Works by Joe Studwell?",
    "text": "How Asia Works by Joe Studwell?\nA Superb work to further my understanding on Political Economy. I came to this book, seeking answers for questions in, How can Tamil Nadu modernize itself?\nAsk an average Tamil, he might give answers like, wearing western clothes, jeans, speaking english, buying toys [iPhones, Cars, T.V, Laptop, Internet] is considered to be modern.\nPerhaps, I am one of the few Tamils around the Globe, and within Tamil Nadu to have taken serious interest in the question,\n“How can Tamil Nadu move towards High-Income State?”“\nJoe (author) introduced me to new writers. The parts which were most interesting to me were Fredrich List & Story of Japan. Fredrich List was a Prussian-American Economic writer, journalist is to be read alongside with Adam Smith. List’s writing and work put a serious blow on my earlier assumptions of Adam Smith.\nList developed national theory of economy. He disagrees with Adam Smith, who says private interest of individuals would lead to highest goods in society. Politicians have two goals, one is to present society and future generation, so this brings up to consider productive powers of a nation in the future, rather than immediate value. He says, a nations true wealth lies in productive power. Being familiar with Japanese history, I was surprised to notice, Meiji Era was strongly influenced by List’s National System.\nRecall, Meiji Era lead towards fast paced modernization of Japan. During process of Modernization, Japan pummeled two victories, one over China and another with Russia in wars. Once, Japan pummeled Russia in Russo-Japanese War. India’s perspective shifted on how an Eastern power is able to rise up to the West [Congress Party]\nThis work filled few own gaps of my understanding in Political History. English East India Company followed economic policy of mercantilism, meaning maximize exports, minimize imports. This had serious consequences such as introducing poppy into China and imperialism, where England could maintain more exports. Although, Many Writers have stated, Mercantilism lead British to Global Superpower at one point in History. It is not clear to me, exactly what happened? Britain only embraced, Free Trade around late 1800s, started promoting Free-trade to other nations.\nMajority of Economic Historians have agreed that it was due to EIC and British in India, India lost their wealth. Even though majority might state this view, I tried to look into alternative views and evidence. A minority of Economic Historians state, India was already on the path of poverty, the British happen to accelerate it. From this work – it seems Historically, Nations have protected their industries, it is not clear, what combination or how much it is to be protected?"

    "text": "What is the meat of this work?\nJoe shares how Asian Economics pursued policies leading the path towards becoming Rich.\nAnswer lies in On Page 189:\nJoe lays out as one, two, three steps based on Historical Review of Asia.\n\n\nHousehold Farming — land redistribution (small farmers work on small plots, increasing productivity)\nExport Discipline — focusing on leading exports at global scale, giving subsidies contingent upon future\nFinance which supports the above two, Household farming and Export Discipline\n\n\nBouke van der Bijl says the following, Studwell distills his extensive research into the economies of nine countries—Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China—into an accessible, readable narrative that debunks Western misconceptions, shows what really happened in Asia and why, and for once makes clear why some countries have boomed while others have languished.\nIf Studwell is right, much of the debate over free markets vs. govt. intervention, or mercantilism vs. free trade, or financial discipline vs. profligacy, is a useless distraction for poor countries. The winning strategy is something that economists don’t even have a name for."

    "section": "Here’s How:",
    "text": "Here’s How:\n\nAgricultural development – When a country is underdeveloped and labor is cheap, it should redistribute farmland to small household farms, and make sure that this is done in a sound way such that the land can’t just be accumulated under one landlord again.\n\nThe reason is that ‘gardening’-style farming as done on such farms, while labor-intensive is much more productive per hectare than large-scale mechanized farming. This will lead to a surplus in yields, which will lead to profits for the families, which they can then re-invest in their farms or use to improve their own living conditions.\nThis policy should also be supported with subsidized fertilizer, education, etc. whatever support the government can give to improve the yield of small farmers. The problem in the Philippines is that, while they tried to do land reform, in the end the big families just regained their land through backdoor policies, and to this day are farming them like plantations, which are profitable but don’t provide the biggest amount of welfare for the nation.\n\nIndustrial policy. The country should nurture an infant manufacturing sector through protectionism and export discipline. The author points out that basically every industrialized country did so through protectionism, including Germany, USA, and the UK.\n\nThe developing country should build up their own expertise, for example by doing technology transfers with foreign firms (while maintaining control) until they can innovate on their own. This should be stimulated by the government. An example from the book, is that during the Korean junta they rounded up all the business leaders and forced them to sign a statement that they agreed to listen to the junta, otherwise all of their possessions would be taken from them. They then coerced them into starting manufacturing businesses like cables etc. The other key factor is that the manufacturing businesses should be forced to compete on a global level through ‘export discipline’, which is policy that incentives businesses to export their products, for example by guaranteeing loans based on purchase orders from abroad (like Korea did).\n\nKeep a tight leash on the financial system. The hire part is that the government should rightly control the finance system and ensure it works to their interests, instead of being captured by profiteers.\n\nAn example was that in the Philippines, where the banks were privatized, the big family businesses all had their own banks which would loan money to the family business, which they would just not pay back, leading to the government picking up the cheque. In Malaysia they liberalized the financial system and IPOd companies prematurely, leading to huge stock market bubbles on unproductive companies. Only after industrialization should the banking sector be liberalized bit by bit."

This means that in your text, you can refer to the figure number and link to the figure. This will automatically update your figure numbers and is achieved by typing the ‘@’ symbol followed by the figure label. As an example, ‘@fig-sleep’ turns into Figure 1.\nThere is an additional option to let the figures take up the width of the entire page, but I would not recommend using it as it extends beyond the width of the body of your page. It requires the following code:\n```{r}\n#| column: page\n```"

This period of Kashmir, was marked by most of the revenues going to Afghanistan from Kashmir, with little room for local Kashmir development.\nIn 1819, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Sikh Empire, conquered Kashmir after defeating Afghans, bringing Kashmir region under Sikh control. Despite changes in political rule, economic conditions of Kashmir remained harsh for Kashmir region, with higher taxes until 1832 famine. Sikhs offered interest free loans to farmers, and Kashmir contributed higher revenues to Sikh empire. During this time, Cashmere wool and Kashmiri shawls became Internationally famous, known for intricate design and artistic craftsmanship."

    "text": "7. Why have attempts for peace failed so far?\nTo bring peace and economic-prosperity to Kashmir, numerous attempts have been tried, except attempts from broader educated Pakistanis, Indians and including myself.\na. UN Plebiscite and International Mediation:\nMultiple United Nations missions for peace failed (Graham, McNaughton, Dixon Plan) as both sides distrusted each other, rejecting proposals. The United Nations called for Plebiscite (vote for Kashmiris to self-determine) in 1948-50s. This was rejected by India and Pakistan could not agree on terms.\nIndia, viewed itself as legal sovereign of Kashmir as Hari Singh signed instrument of accession. Third—party mediation proposed by US, UK to send peacekeeping forces, was rejected by India, as India views it as an internal matter, and opposes outside intervention.\nb. Exclusion of local Kashmirs:\nWhat’s most disheartening is both sides distrust each other, negotiations, dialogue is between elites, government officials with ordinary Kashmiris excluded from negotiations. This exclusion is akin to having outsiders decide, without strong political voice, representation from local Kashmiris, undermining peace-talks and legitimacy, effectiveness of prosperity, peace in Kashmir.\nc. Independence or Joint Sovereignty claims:\nNeither India nor Pakistan supports independence, as both claim the territory in full, which leaves little room for comprise. Domestic politics and nationalism fuels this, leaving no political room for leaders in Pakistan and India to appear flexible in Kashmir.\nd. How Culture is stumbling block for Kashmir?\nEspecially in Honor-Shame cultures of Pakistan-India, conforming to group is essential, it is of high importance to appear strong, vulnerability or flexible is a sign of weakness, not source of Strength.\nIn honor-shame culture, the primary concern is maintain honor/face at all costs, which is a nation or family, compromise is sign of weakness, leaders might scape-goat, rather than responsibility to avoid shame on them.\nIn Guilt-Law culture of the West, behavior is governed by rules and laws. Negotiations are focused on fairness, compromise is necessary and part of resolving, showing vulnerability creates trust on the Leaders, rather than weakness. Compromise and Flexibility are seen as responsible, lawful and honorable ways to resolve, progress conflicts…."

    "text": "8. How can Kashmir break free from cycling conflict?\nMoving Forward: Practical Steps towards Kashmir’s prosperity\nWhile Indians, Pakistanis might believe religion as major hurdle towards prosperity, I see this as superficial. History shows us otherwise, where completely different worldviews can work together putting shared goals and interests together, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s partnership with Ibn-Saud.\nHistory demonstrates that creative solutions are possible, as seen when Japan suffered profound loss of face, shame and humiliation, defeat by Fat Man and Little Boy signing the San Francisco Peace Treaty after World War II, reconciling with U.S\nThe real barrier is political will among leaders of India, China and Pakistan. As well as insufficient civic, community engagement of educated Indians, Pakistanis and lack of desire and steps for broader peace, security, economic prosperity for meaningful Kashmiris progress.\nAdmittedly, territorial are incredibly hard to resolve, as land, resources are tied to national identity and pride. Honor-shame dynamic adds more fuel to this dynamic, which portrays comprise as sign of weakness, prioritization reputation/face, discouraging heartfelt apology as weakness. A Leader who admits weakness will be ridiculed in honor-shame culture, thus recent speech by Pakistani Military leader, who acts in accordance to the cultural norms."

    "section": "Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development by B.R. Ambedkar",
    "text": "Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development by B.R. Ambedkar\nRecently, I encountered Ambedkar’s ideas again while reading Social-Organization and Religion of Piramalai Kallar by Louis Dumont, one of the most influential 20th century french anthropologists.\nTo this day, Ambedkar’s works are extremely popular. His pictures are frequently found in villages all over India. Streets are named in his name. Many villages have flagpoles showing support for Ambedkar.\nIn this short anthropology paper, Ambedkar speaks the core binding glue of India’s Caste as Endogamy. He examines definitions of castes by various scholars, as too little or too much.\nCaste’s definition, according to Ambedkar is prohibition of Intermarriage between different castes, sub-castes.\nBy this definition of Ambedkar, Tamil speaking people living in Tamil Country might be most practitioners of caste in day-to-day family-life.\nAmbedkar moves towards Surplus Man & Surplus Women problem, which Indians used to resolve by Sati or forced widowhood, polygyny, remarriage was blocked under caste-rules.\nSo we have, following categories of castes:\n(a) Brahmans, Priestly caste\n(b) Kshatriyas, Military caste\n(c) Vaisya, Merchant Caste\n(d) Sudra, artisans\n+– Dalits are outside the four.\nAmbedkar says, at some point in Indian History, priestly castes socially detached themselves, closed doors or psychologically, some found doors closed against them. On Origin & Spread of Caste, Ambedkar speaks of Brahmins, who practiced this custom, and other castes imitated them as law-givers were Brahmins. He says caste existed before, Manu, the first Man & Manu-smriti [Laws of Manu]\nMahatma Gandhi disagreed with Ambedkar, urging to judge Hinduism through best adherents and reform gradually, rather to condemn entire adherents of Hinduism through worst practitioners.\nAmbedkar insisted on political and legal protection of Dalits.\nDue to Ambedkar’s scholarship, Indian Constitution adopted:\n\nArticle 15 – Promoting equal opportunity, regardless of religion, caste affiliation\n\nArticle 16 – Promoting equal opportunity and affirmative action for certain castes\n\nArticle 17 – Abolishing untouchability\n\nArticle 46 – Promoting wellbeing of Dalits\n\nThe difference between caste & class, caste is permanent, legally ascribed to you in India. But, you cannot change your caste, certainly class shifts over life-time. Recently, I was saddened to hear a speech on Caste, by a Tamil Politician not adhering to authentic claims by people from both perspectives. To me, it seemed he was doing politics not adhering to historical truths and sharing authentic sources. Now, I am eager to find out, thought-out responses on Caste’s anthropology, sociology from Hindu, Islam perspective – here’s why? I observed, the goal of this Tamil politician was mainly to engage with his audience and keep them divided, their votes, not strive for social-political solution."

It’s evolution starts from Aristotle’s logical reasoning, through insights of powerful islamic scholars like Ibn Al-Haytham, Al-Kindi, Avicenna to more structured approaches of modern thinkers like Francis Bacon, Galileo, Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.\nBrief approaches of Scientific Method:\nFrancis Bacon: Bacon emphasized inductive reasoning—starting from observations and experiments, then deriving general principles. For example, studying the boiling point of various liquids under different pressures to discover the relationship between pressure and boiling temperature.\nCartesian Method (René Descartes): Descartes advocated for deductive reasoning from self-evident truths or axioms. Starting with the certainty of thought (“I think, therefore I am”), he worked downward using logic. This is similar to how mathematicians start from axioms to derive theorems.\nNewtonian Method (Isaac Newton): Newton combined induction and mathematical reasoning. He observed falling apples and celestial motions, then formulated universal laws of gravity and motion through experimentation and mathematical modeling.\nTogether, these approaches underpin the modern science:\nThis model has been enormously successful in explaining natural phenomena—from engineering, planetary motion to electricity and genetics."

Limits of the Scientific Method\nHowever, problems arise when people attempt to apply this framework outside its proper domain—particularly to theology, human experience, aesthetics, or ethics, philosophy. For instance, I frequently encounter engineers insisting on applying hypo-deductive logic to questions like, “What is the purpose of life? or applying at religion, theology.”\nEven late physicist like Stephen Hawking insist on using this particular method for such questions. This clash arises from philosophical assumptions—especially positivism, the belief that true knowledge can only be derived from sensory experience and empirical verification."

Knowledge = what we can observe, measure, and test. Works well in physics and chemistry.\nExample: Measuring how many hours students study and correlating it with exam scores.\nInterpretivism: Assumes reality is subjective, shaped by human experience and context. Truth emerges from meaning, not measurement.\nExample: Understanding how a student feels during an exam, and how their background or family pressure influences performance.\nConstructivism: Proposes that reality is socially constructed. What we call “truth” is built through shared language, culture, and historical context.\nExample: The idea of “success” differs radically between Tamil Middle Class, Wealthy Tamil families, rural, urban India, and corporate America—constructed by each culture, for Tamil middle class, doctor or engineer is highest success, for few Tamils, living a happy life is success, for some having a family."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. This tool supports analysis of supermarket products and generates results to interpret consumer behavior, to give businesses deeper insights into targeted consumer markets. The software design developed is named as Kodai. Kodai is horizontally reusable and can be adapted across various industries. This software framework allows testing a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Kodai has several advantages, such as analyzing and visualizing data, and as a result, businesses can make better decisions. In addition to these advantages, Kodai is open-source, which means any developer can access the code, and develop into client requirements. With the described features, it is better than other similar tools such as Gephi, a free visualization and manipulation tool.\nThe retail industry has grown exponentially, resulting in increasing demand for software tools to analyze consumer behavior. The analysis of consumer behavior helps businesses to stay at the forefront of market competition and provide excellent service. By focusing on consumer purchase behavior, Kodai can perform analyses, meaning it can classify consumers based on variables that capture their behavior. An example is identifying consumers who spend the most amount of money in a supermarket.\nSegmentation models provide qualitative and quantitative methods to improve service for the customer and revenues for the company. These models can be used in different fields such as finance, education and healthcare. Another important feature of Gephi is its interactive and visual modeling capabilities to help understand consumer behavior. Additionally, the software is reusable and supports the integration of future tools, following key extensibility concepts of software design.\nThis thesis explains the implementation of Kodai as a software architecture through segmentation models using a web-based application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues and consumer experience. This tool is developed to facilitate segmentation of consumer data based on purchase behavior with the goal of allowing the user to test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets. Most importantly, the software is reusable and can be adapted horizontally across various industries.\n\n\n Download \n\n\nOur work in this thesis helps to show that Kodai is a software architecture for segmentation models to improve revenues for a supermarket. It can test a hypothesis to address the problem of increasing revenues in supermarkets.\nWe achieved this by allowing the user to upload supermarket data within the software framework, using a webbased application that implements software engineering methodology to improve revenues, allowing the developer to complete business requirements to be built into the software."

One who spends an extravagant amount of money for weddings receives highest honor and face. One who invites 10,000–20,000 people for their son/daughter’s wedding gains prestige.\nMarrying within their clan allows them to retain social-financial kinship networks.\n\nChapter two gave me a glimpse of Nagarathar beliefs:\n\nNagarathar women are fed to believe, “Arranged Marriage” marrying same endogamy kin is honorable, face-giving. This is a majority belief among South-Indian Women/Castes.\n\nWhen I was reading, it struck me the mindset, beliefs, and worldview are the same among the majority of Tamils. This is not confined to the Nagarathar caste, but applies to almost all Tamils."

Strong social, family, and kinship relationships kept women adhering to these beliefs.\nIn reality, genetic scientists can communicate there’s no such thing as pure caste or race.

It is the glue of the caste-system in modern India. However, Nagarathars limited themselves within a small social network bubble that did not allow their financial institutions to modernize or be part of global financial centers.\nThey could not modernize or develop their financial services further. For example, London and New York City are hubs of institutions providing specialized financial services & products closely related to Nagarathars’ work. As they failed to adapt to changing times and customs, Nagarathars lost the majority of their wealth, with only a few families spared. Their occupations transitioned to professional white-collar careers and offering financial lending.\nNagarathars, at their peak in the early 20th century, held/owned 570,000 acres in Burma. They gained Burmese land by providing lending services to rice farmers. Unfortunately, they lost 3/5th during WWII.\nTheir loss is also a loss of human capital, financial skills, and financial capital expertise for entire South India. South India does not have specialized financial sectors like London or New York.\nConcretely, South India could have developed using Nagarathars’ financial acumen—creating their own Wall Street.\nTo be part of the modern economy, especially the financial services sector, requires strong computing, physics, and financial skills to manage such enterprises, which requires openness.\nCredits to Muthu Palaniappan for recommending this book.\n\nSource:\n\nGender, Kinship & Property Rights by Yuko Nishimura\nA Tamil library stands testament of Capitalism"

Protectionism helped developmental phase of American industries to safeguard from European competitors. The government established bureau of mines, standards that actively enabled progress of American Agriculture and Industry.\nHe observes, America’s industry focus on efficiency, large scale production using corporation and trusts is a major factor in its industry success. We can conclude the wealthiest nation on the planet was built on protective tariffs, with active government support for research and development. He even notices during World War 1, United Kingdom, abandoned laissez-faire economic policy, into actively supporting, protect and nurturing local industries.\n\n\n1.2 Japan as role model for India\nVisvesvaraya viewed Japan’s industrialization from 1868 to 1912 as role-model. India’s policy was laissez-faire, which he argues wouldn’t work without active support of government to nurture, protect, build industries. In 2025, we see parallels looking at China which actively nurtured their local industries, protected until they became mature to compete on Global markets."

    "section": "4. Agriculture in India: Conservative Habits or Rational Choice?",
    "text": "4. Agriculture in India: Conservative Habits or Rational Choice?\nI’ve always shunned to think, contemplate of entire India’s issues, so I limited myself to my own state, Tamil Nadu. However, in this work, I learnt how Visvesvaraya was able to deftly write down problems of entire India. The first chapter, He puts India as the center, compares with advanced nations as UK, Japan, Canada, US.\nIn 1920, He says, majority of Indians were depended on Agriculture for their livelihood, so India as a majority was poor. As agriculture did not allow to help material condition of majority Indians. Most of the manufactured goods, finished goods were imported from abroad.\nOne impressionable part from his work, which I agree is the modernization of India. He was inspired by Japan’s modernization in 1920. He shares how India can follow the same path, apply the methods, processes, systems Japanese used to modernize the country. Moreover, avoid the pitfalls which plagued some of the advanced countries as poor living conditions (slums). He observed living conditions of India’s villages were poorer than slums. In Urbanization, He suggests proper town-planning, industrialization. Although in 2025, India suffers greatly in large scale urbanization problem.\nHe was inspired by the industrialization of the West. He encouraged Indians to visit, travel the world, learn the best practices in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Governance.\n\n4.1 Visvesvaraya’s Call to learn from Abroad:\n“The best method of national activity should be selected. This will be possible only if delegations of Indian statesmen, students and business men are sent abroad to study up-to-date foreign systems, theories and practices.”\n\n\n4.2 Reflections from Theodore Schultz\nIn Agriculture, He covers usual issue of India’s agriculture as lack of applicability of scientific practices, due to farmers clinging to conservative old habits of past. From 1920 to 2025, We have come long way in Indian Agriculture. I am cautious to point fingers or blame, as I came across, Nobel Prize Winner’s Theodore Schultz work who contributed to, “Human Capital”.\nHe worked among poor eastern European farmers, during his lifetime (1902-1998), came up with interesting observations, rather than blaming them for making rational decisions. He says poverty of farmers, was not due to small land-size, land fertility, laziness but rather higher cost, lack of availability of productive inputs. The constraint was lack of access to profitable, modern inputs and knowledge. He came to the conclusion, given the conditions, the traditional farmers were making the most rational decision, so it was not that they were lazy or not trying to expand activities in agriculture, they were limited, due to high taxes and artificial low agricultural prices set by their government.\nHe came to the conclusion in the work, Transforming Traditional Agriculture that the best way to help them was to change old inputs into newer more profitable inputs and allowing them to make their own decisions, with less government intervention. This resulted in high yield varieties during green revolution (1960s, 1970s) which became central to India’s Green Revolution. So Schultz’s point is that farmers adapted due to economic incentives, innovate when profitable technologies are available. So, if we agree with Theodore Schultz, small land holdings in agriculture might not be the major limiting factor.\nAnyway, In 1920, during Visvesvaraya’s time, Agriculture was poorer in India. At the moment, 47-48% of India’s population are involved in agricultural activities, comparing with America’s 1-2% of the population, it might increase to 18% if you include food processing units, indirectly related farm activities like transportation, agricultural related retail.\n\n\n4.3 Visvesvaraya’s urgent calls to modernize:\nHe says, “The first practical step is to enable Indians in increasing numbers to see for themselves what science is doing to improve agriculture throughout the world. Parties of representative men, from every province, should be encouraged to travel abroad, especially to Japan.”"

Industrialization and Economic Modernization:\nWith respect to Industries, he says, Industries of a country reflect productive capabilities, executive abilities, and forms chief tests of a nation’s efficiency. In 1920 — India’s Shipbuilding industry depended on British support. Visvesvaraya asks if the British could support India’s industries, both countries could benefit industrialization as a win-win situation. Throughout the book, Visvesvaraya compares U.S’s industries, Dominion of Canada and Japan’s industries. At that time in India’s Economic History, he highlights needs in the following:\n\nTextiles — cotton, woollen and silk\nSmelting of ores — manganese, lead, copper, etc.\nIron and steel\nManufacture of machinery and other articles of iron and steel\nShipbuilding\nChemical industries — dyes, sulphuric acid, soda ash, artificial manures, etc.\nPorcelain, glass, cement\nPaper-pulp and paper\nLeather industries\nSugar\n\nSo all these industries are actively part of India’s industry in 2025. In Organization, Visvesvaraya asks citizens to be part of social groups, nonprofits, supports religious organizations and chamber of commerce."

    "text": "The Thirumathi Lakshmi Valar Tamizh library, recently donated by P.A Chidambaram, former Finance Minister of India. The library is a transformative social gift, uplifting society through knowledge to people of Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu.\nTo me, this library is not just a physical structure but a reflection of the philanthropic spirit of the Nagarathar Chettiars, a mercantile social group in India. P.A Chidambaram (1945) is the great‑great‑grandson of Sathappa Ramanatha Muthiah (1840–1900).\n\nFigure: Sathappa Ramanatha Muthiah Chettiar (1840–1900), visionary patriarch of the Nagarathar Chettiars.\nNagarathar Chettiars are a Tamil social group who modeled a unique form of Tamil capitalism rooted in dharma, unwavering service, and long‑term vision. Sathappa Ramanatha Muthiah Chettiar embodied the finest values of wealth with restraint, discipline with devotion, Saivism with simplicity, and capitalism rooted in local culture.\nI am genuinely in awe of this contribution. A library of this scale likely represents a capital expenditure of ₹60–70 crores (US $10–15 million).\nTo me, it’s not the monetary value but the spirit of the act that moves me deeply, communicating timeless values of the Nagarathar Chettiars: frugality, hard work, faith, and the wise use of wealth to uplift Tamil society. In contrast, industrialists in regions like Nagercoil and Tirunelveli often operate within narrow social circles focused on family prestige, status, or short‑term gain. The Nagarathar Chettiars embodied a higher purpose and long‑term vision.\n\n“Commerce for the Chettiars was not merely a means to accumulate wealth. It was a disciplined moral order…They built tanks to water fields, schools, colleges, to educate, temples to bind communities, and libraries to refine minds.”\n— David West Rudner, Caste and Capitalism in Colonial India\n\nTherefore, we all can learn from these timeless values—practice them and share them.\nSource:\n\nNewly donated Library\nSathappa Ramanatha Muthiah Chettiar\nReview of Caste and Capitalism by David West Rudner\nCaste and Capitalism full text\nKarti Chidambaram’s post"

    "title": "Book Summary: Macroeconomics: An Introduction by Alex M. Thomas",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1. Why read this work?\n\nTo get an introduction to Economics\nTo understand Indian Macro-Economics\nTo weave together different economic school of thought\nTo understand how caste system affects broader Indian Society\n\n\n\n2. What does Alex say in this work?\nOutline:\n\nWhat is economics\nConceptualizing the macroeconomy\nMoney and interest rates\nOutput and employment levels\nEconomic growth\nWhy economic theory matters\nThe policy objective of full employment\nThe policy objective of low inflation\nTowards good economics\n\nLet me try to summarize my highlights\nSo, Alex wants you to understand economics is not a settled science. I recall, he mentioned it is ongoing discussion among economists. In many of the college textbooks, they might present it as settled. He asks students, learners to inquiry, ask questions.\nI liked the quote from Keynes,\n“He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man’s nature or his institution lie entirely outside of his regard”\nWhile reading this quote, I thought of earlier history of India. Many might recall, Colonialism, many have to be understood in contextual clue. At that time, it seems to me that Mercantilism was the school of thought, which says a country has to export more than imports.\nI want the reader to ask, “How did economic school of thought impact EIC in India?”\nAlex furthermore shares briefly about History of Economics:\n\nEIC\nMercantilism\nPolitical Economists\nMarginalist\nClassical Economists\nKeynesian Economics\n20th Century [Monetarism, Institutionalism, Sraffa’s Economics, Samuel’s Textbook]\n\nAdam Smith was interested in finding nature of wealth, causes of wealth in nations\nAdam Smith says,\nPolitical economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects: first, to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people, or more properly to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and secondly, to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services. It proposes to enrich people and sovereign.\nRicardo says, “the Principal Problem [remaining] in Political Economy is to determine, laws which to regulate, distribution of rent, profit and wages.”\nIn later chapter, Alex says, Economics these days are redefining the field as, “Science of Choice”\nAlex has communicated basics of Macro-Economics coherently. His analysis or focus is on Indian Economy, which is not same as developed economies in West. Economists have conceptualized sectors such as Primary, Secondary, Tertiary. These are ways to understand sectors, growth for Economists. I recall, Alex stating, Service sector is growing, which means more jobs in the field.\nPrimary Sector includes agriculture, here is where Caste comes in play. Due to less manufacturing jobs available in India; Imagine being an Adivasi’s child, without any skillset or training. What would you work as? Servant of a Billionaire? When reading this, I felt sad.\nMy own understanding is well-being of people of all social strata is to be considered. So, I understood if Construction sector is growing, it affects well-being of construction worker. It makes sense. Recall, what matters is growth of a sector, which is what you belong. This would contribute to your well-being and family.\nHe also mentions how Caste system is rigid, where most of the time, mobility is restricted. Even in Indian Society, Patriarchy limits women with careers. So, something that I thought about, Economists have theories on how to understand, predict or formulate policies. Theories give proper framework, and in one of the chapters. Alex mentions, “There is nothing as practical as a good theory” This seems counter-intuitive to layman, although it is actual truth and reality.\nIn Chapter of Financial Architect, I gained further understanding. I was able to weave my understanding of financial instruments, Depending on liquidity. From LIC Policy, Mutual Fund, Bank Deposit, Currency. This made sense, Economists classify money using their own jargon, M1, M2, M3, M4. Depending on school of thought, economists give answer to employment & output. From what I recall, Keynesian’s work recommends government implication to raise output & employment levels. Marginalist theory tends to state the opposite.\nAlex weaved stories of Families. A Muslim family, without any education. A Bother has to get her sister married, take care of other’s in family [parents]. So, he leaves abroad, sends remittance, such is the pithy of Muslim families. He asks, does Muslims have Agriculture land? Do they have reservation?\nWhile reading this, it helped me to gain further depth understanding in Caste-System. Of course, I do desire for people to gain decent living, so they can provide for their families. In return, families are happy, neighborhoods are happier. There are theories of growth, depending on supply side or demand side. This was interesting for me, mostly one side says, increase in technology. Increase in technology would cause higher growth of economy. In Capitalistic economics, Marx said, there will be a recurrent crisis. This is due to underconsumption & disproportional between sectors.\nAnother question that is in my mind, “So Why is Mercantilism Wrong?” I’m afraid one of the popular CEO’s of Tamil Nadu subscribes to Mercantilism. I could be wrong, not sure. He states, “Exports must be greater than imports” This seems to be obvious as layman, more exports means more wealth correct?\nBrief understanding of Mercantilism. During 1600-1857, Recall, EIC and others were competing for dominance - How? They believed, having more gold [bullion], in exchange of trade, would enable them to raise armies. Recall, this was during time of Slave trade. This was dominant economic school of thought. Smith says, Mercantalism was wrong - Why?\n\nProtectionism policies of Business Interests [British Navigation Act of 1651]\nWealth was not Gold of Nation - so what is it?\nWealth was productivity of Nations\nThis lead to Comparative Advantage\nComparative Advantage lead to specialization\nCreating more efficiency\nIndustrial Revolution thrived due to free trade\nPolicies favoring Big Business, ruling elites would decrease standard of living\nAdditionally, would create higher inequalities\n\nIn the Chapter of Economic Theory, Alex is stating the necessity of good theory. A Good theory enables towards understanding behavior, data, and formulating right policies. Earlier, I shared how good theory is as practical as you can imagine. The Figure which caught my attention was Income level. Furthermore, Caste makes a big role in people’s lives, it seems to debar opportunities, access to mobility. In the Chapter of Inflation: Alex mentions about Wholesale Price Index. So price of basic commodities increases - Why? Depending on your school of thought, you’d give a response. Either Too much money chasing too few goods or A shock to a sector which produces effect, if you are Keynesian.\n\n\n3.

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced the use of moviebarcode for video categorization and summarization and showed that video processing is easier with moviebarcode for social computing researchers, especially if they deal with YouTube which is the most popular video sharing platform.\nTraditional techniques for video categorization are resource intensive and time consuming. Moviebarcode is a great methodology to extract insightful features to describe narratives in a video, capturing visual patterns in a video without watching, and grouping/categorizing similar/same videos together in fast and efficient manner. Results show that using individual channels of a moviebarcode image helps video categorization by differentiating one video from another or grouping them. Each channel carries different features about an image. The idea of splitting channels of an image increased the performance of video categorization"

Nilakanta Sastri’s Historical Method in Relation to Problems of South Indian History, where he defines four methods: heuristic, criticism, synthesis, and exposition. This led me to Sir William Irvine’s exhaustive—but unfinished—twelve years of Mughal source collection, later completed by Sir Jadunath Sarkar. Sarkar’s works on Shivaji (1919) and his five-volume Aurangazeb series (1912–24) epitomize scholarly rigor.\nIn contrast, many contemporary writers fall short of the Rankean ideal “to show what actually occurred,” opting instead for narratives that score political points or serve communal agendas."

    "text": "2. Majumdar’s Analysis\n\nMajumdar examines historians from 1750–1850, detailing evolving source materials, translations, and manuscript discoveries. He shows that the nineteenth century was dominated by English historians; only in the twentieth did Indian scholars begin to contribute in earnest. He critiques James Mill’s standard textbook for its bias against Hindus and its flawed ancient chronology.\nI wonder how the 1900–1950 generation balanced national pride with objective scholarship—many popularized the narrative “the British took away all our wealth.” Majumdar insists that truth must guide the historian, quoting Jadunath Sarkar:\n\n“I would not care whether truth is pleasant or unpleasant, and in consonance with or opposed to current views. I would not mind in the least whether truth is or is not a blow to the glory of my country. If necessary, I shall bear in patience the ridicule and slander of friends and society for the sake of preaching truth. But still I shall seek truth, understand truth, and accept truth. This should be the firm resolve of a historian.”\n\nThanks to Professor Rajat Kumar Pradhan for the recommendation."

The violence was triggered by the legislative assembly by-election, following U. Muthuramalinga Thevar’s resignation. In the peace conference organized by the local administration, Muthuramalinga Thevar objected to the presence of Immanuel Sekaran as a Dalit representative.\nThis is a long review. You may gain new perspective. Read it completely. Book is clear, well-researched, easy to follow."

    "section": "3. What is my own view on this?",
    "text": "3. What is my own view on this?\nI want to bring better insight in this. My own insight is the following.\nEntire narrative of Tamil Society is to gain:\n\n\nHonor (Munju)\nand not to lose, Face (kaevalam)**\n\n\nTo lose face (kaevalam), is to lose your identity.\nWhen someone loses face, they lose their life or standing in society. Japanese soldiers in WW2, would kill themselves instead of being defeated –Why? Because, they lose face and they bring shame to their community. Therefore, killing themselves is more honorable.\nI would cite anthropologist, Ruth Benedict in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, for bringing this perspective. She wrote about Japanese culture. This view is not present in any of the discussions in understanding culture.\nBasic unit of Tamil Culture is family, mother-father’s face (munju) or family name. Next, you are part of a community (caste) or (religion). There is fierce competition to gain face among relatives, caste or religious community through socio-economic ways in Tamil Nadu.\nOne might object that caste ought to be removed. Yes — What would replace that vacuum of social hierarchy of relationship?\nHow would communities represent themselves politically?\n\nAdvantages of honor/shame:\n\n\nBehaviors can be controlled by shame\nCompetition among people\nFamilies are close-knit\nLoyalty to clan\nNot wanting shame motivates people\nStrict hierarchy: Person knows their role in society\n\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of honor/shame:\n\n\nPeople are not honest\nPeople would cover up their short-comings during conversation\nIt is actually not a lie when they cover up, it’s just they don’t want to lose face\nBut real relationship starts with vulnerability\nTrust comes through by accepting vulnerability.\n\n\nTruth is less important when it comes with face. To hold face is more important. How did you change your view on criminal tribes and caste?\nThis is related to the book. Most people in Tamil Nadu, hold the view, “some people in a community are born criminals, some have innate nature to do so.” Many years ago — I was on a road trip with an American friend.\nI remember constantly telling him, i.e some castes are violent or bad, their character is bad, their character is to do evil. He stopped the car, and told me, wait, “You are calling someone bad or violent or murderer before they even commit such act.” How can you say it? I could not understand what I was thinking. Apparently, I had labeled people. Before, even they are born, to malign their character. This is clearly wrong. People can change, characters can be changed innately by emulating desirable traits.\nIn Tamil Nadu, even older people, would say, “It’s like it, this community is as such.” Within the narrative of religious tradition it says:\n\n\nPeople are created in the image of their Creator\nHis Creator has reason, dignity, love along with other attributes\nPeople are bestowed with these attributes\nTherefore, people are to be respected, loved with dignity\n\n\nYou might contest the above narrative. Good luck forming a secular origin of human dignity. It took me so much time to realize, I was wrong. We can’t label an entire community. Later, I spent more time to figure out, what was happening. Most of the time, people grow up in a family, and then stay within their community. Now, people hear about other community through the lens of that community. Would we look into our own family, community through the lens of others, and improve ourselves?\nThis might be because, the value of the community picks up specific aspects of other community, and labels them. It could be confirmation bias."

    "text": "4. What’s the meat of the book?\nIn this book, author Mani Kumar talks about the riots of Mudukulathur, located close to Ramanathapuram in Southern Tamil Nadu. It’s about two communities — Pallars and Thevars. Mani Kumar gives an account on political history, social justice, caste-conflict among the two communities. In Tamil Nadu political history, caste plays a crucial role. Each community aligns with a political party. There’s gruesome killings on each side of caste. When I was reading through account of it. Few questions came to my mind. A question - one person gets killed for an issue from a caste. And then, the other community kills or retaliates back. But it goes back and forth, where does it stop?\n\nWhat is the point of doing it?\nIn the book or even applying to Tamil society, insight from anthropologists. Apply honor-shame, we can answer, “to gain face.” (Munju) to get, “honor.” or “respect” among others within their community.\nHow can they change?\nAuthor says Education can change people.\nWhat other work would you recommend?\nThere has been no contemporary account of caste that matches up Edgar Thurston. Thurston’s work is outdated, because it is filled with racial denigration.\nSociologists have written about Caste. If you want to know about Caste in Tamil Nadu. I suggest reading, Edgar Thurston. His work is outdated, but some parts of it, might be relevant. Apparently, in 2019, I discovered Edgar was the first to hold Librarian title— Connemara Public Library."
