# 1. Why care about this?

This is one of my best read books.

> 0. Depth
 1. Quality
 2. Cognition required to understand

Also, a Foundation for Classical Liberalism,
While reading Humboldt's dense writings,
I inferred, Perhaps? 


> In 17-18th century, quality of education was admirable

This work would help, anyone raise their level of thoughts.
To raise one's quality of thought - What should we do?

We must read writers, engage with, who are better than us. 
For that - one requires persistence, curiosity, and herculean effort.

# 2. What is this about?

Von Humboldt was a Prussian Writer, Civil Servant, contributed for Classical Liberalism. Von Humboldt's ideas were influential for Higher Education.
Humboldt asks, "To what end, state institutions; should be set to their activity?"

To respond to this, He writes this entire book.
I'd suggest reading it.
To make it relevant to contemporary Tamil Nadu, India.

## Could we apply this to Politics in Tamil Nadu?

My hunch is, We are forcing western concepts work into local Tamil Politics.

# 3. What did I learn in this?

I learnt about Freedom, Principles for Classical Liberalism.

How in Tamil Nadu - we do not have, foundational works in Political thought?

My own vague response, perhaps from Sangam Literature?
Maybe, someone could re-construct or advance knowledge in Tamil Political thought?

My favorite part from the book,

Humboldt says,

**"Men who love labor for its own sake, improve it by their plastic genius and inventive skill, cultivate intellect and refine their pleasures."**

Political theorist, lay foundation, upon which, political parties stand upon. From there, Politicians formulate positions on issues.

I would recommend this book to everyone.
